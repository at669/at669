## Hey! 

I'm a software developer with a hardware background, and I think games are neat.

I've recently received my M.Eng in Computer Science and a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, with a minor in Game Design. My interests span **game development**, **VR/AR**, **hardware**, and **robotics**.
