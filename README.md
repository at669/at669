## Hey! 

I'm a software developer with a hardware background, and I think games are neat.

I've recently received my M.Eng in Computer Science and a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University, with a minor in Game Design. My interests span **game development**, **VR/AR**, **hardware**, and **robotics**. In my spare time, I enjoy listening to and making music, playing and making video games, falling off my skateboard, and taking low-quality pictures of dogs.

### Currently working on: 

- ü§ñ  [Unity Robotics](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub)
- ‚öîÔ∏è  [Shujinkou](http://ricegames.net/)
