## Hey!

I'm a software developer with a hardware background and I make games for fun (and for a living).

I've recently received my M.Eng in Computer Science from Cornell Tech and a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University, with a minor in Game Design. My interests span **game development**, **VR/AR**, **hardware** and **robotics**, and generally how technology interacts with each other and the world. In my spare time, I enjoy listening to and making music, playing and making video games, falling off my skateboard, and taking low-quality pictures of dogs.
